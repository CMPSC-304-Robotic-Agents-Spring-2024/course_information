## Description

A study of the design and implementation of autonomous software agents and robotic systems that cooperatively complete complex tasks. In addition to examining techniques for large-scale coordination and group-based decision-making, students learn how to apply the field's technologies to address the challenges facing local and global communities. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students develop and evaluate several multi-agent or multi-robot systems, while also reflecting on the civic issues surrounding the use of these systems. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. 

Prerequisite: CMPSC 101 or CMPSC 102.

Focus: Quantitative Reasoning, Civic Learning.

### Materials

There is no required textbook for this course. All reading material will be provided by the instructor and linked on the [course schedule](#Schedule). 

## Objectives

Complex modern digital problems often require sophisticated computer programs, or agents, that act autonomously on behalf of their users and interact with hardware. This course will introduce students to the foundational principles behind robotic agents and to the civic issues, public challenges, and opportunities in this field. Areas of discussion include, but are not limited to sensors, perception, robot navigation and localization, motion planning, machine learning in robots, state of the art robotic applications, robotics in K-12 education, renewable energy, misuse of intelligent software and hardware, and various public issues utilizing agent/robotic systems as a solution.

The course will introduce students to the practice of agent-based and robotic systems while covering both the well-established and the cutting-edge areas of the discipline. The course also invites students to design and develop several robotic system applications and to assess the correctness of their implementations. This will require students to work both with hardware and with software throughout the course. Moreover, the course will ask students to reflect on several public problems at local, national and international level that are or can be solved using robotic technologies and to study social systems behind them. In addition to improving their teamwork skills, students will enhance their ability to write and speak about agent-based and robotic systems in a clear and concise fashion. Through civic engagement activities, students will also strengthen their skill of clearly communicating technical details to the general public.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Identify components of the robot and associate each part with its task in a complete robotic system.
2. Design, implement, and test robotic applications for a wheeled, arm, and aerial robots.
3. Demonstrate the use of a robot operating system (ROS) in simulation and in wheeled robots.
4. Demonstrate actuating, sensing, locomotion, navigation, manipulation, and learning capabilities of robotic systems.
5. Describe the ethical and social impact of robotics on public problems and participate in civic engagement activities with robots, while additionally reflecting on the nuances of public problems.

### Distribution Learning Outcomes

- Civic Learning (CL): Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of economic, political, legal, cultural, natural, historical, or social forces that affect public problems or civic issues.

  Program learning outcomes 2 and 5 satisfy CL learning outcome.

- Quantitative Reasoning (QR): Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of how to interpret numeric data and/or their graphical or symbolic representations.

  Program learning outcomes 2, 3, and 4 satisfy QR learning outcome.

## Community Guidelines

Interactions of students amongst themselves, as well as with the course instructor and the Technical Leaders must be respectful at all times. All members of the course are expected to contribute to the classroom environment being welcoming, inclusive, and engaging. 

Course members are representatives of this course, Computer and Information Science department, and Allegheny College, when engaging in the local community, and as such must present the best representation of themselves. All members must learn about the community with which they are to engage and consider the impacts of their communications, actions and interactions in the community.

When working as a team, all project decisions should be made as a team. Team members must decide how they conduct the work, divide the work as needed, and should hold each other accountable. All project work must be completed in a branch on GitHub, and allow for appropriate GitHub flow process using Pull Requests and Merges. Team members should use Discord and GitHub to communicate with each other about the project.

Each team is responsible for the hardware they work with during each project. All supplies taken out of ALIC need to be documented in the project's report. All tools and supplies must be returned to ALIC when are no longer in use.

#### Class Activities

All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. During nearly all class sessions, you will be required to complete and submit class activities (individually and in teams). You will receive a checkmark grade (1) if you complete more than 70% of the activity; otherwise you will receive a 0.

##### Presentations

At various points of the course, students will engage with learning "hot topics" as they relate to robotics in the field and civic learning and report on their findings to our class community. Each presentation will count as a class activity.

#### Projects

Graded on a percentage and credit/no-credit basis, five project assignments, invite students to experiment with various tools and techniques for designing, implementing, evaluating, and documenting your robotic agent system. Additionally, you will be required to submit reflections on the civic learning components if relevant to the particular project.  To best ensure that students are ready to develop software  after graduation, students will complete most of the lab assignments in teams. Many of the lab assignments in this course will expect students to give both a presentation and a demonstration of the system that they created.

#### Community Engagement

A significant portion of the course asks the students to study and reflect on public problems related to the field of robotics. As a part of civic learning in this course you will be required to engage in the community. This will mainly involve developing software and hardware to be presented to our local community and then participating in appropriate outreach events. 

#### Quizzes

The quiz will cover all of the material in its associated module and are short 10 question assessments completed during the class session. Five quizzes are anticipated throughout the semester. Unless prior arrangements are made with the instructor, all students will be expected to take the quizzes on the
scheduled dates. 

#### Assignment Submission

All assignments have a stated due date and are to be turned in on that due date. By submitting each assignment a student pledges that they have complied with Allegheny Honor Code. You must follow assignment instructions for submitting your projects in order for them to be graded. Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline.

#### Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend all of the class and laboratory sessions. There are two types of excused absences: 1) the one you notify the instructor about in advance (for example, if you have a job interview during the class/lab time or have a religious observance), 2) the one that occurs due to a documented emergency or illness. If you will not be able to attend a session, please let the instructor know at least one day in advance to describe your situation. In case you missed a class because of an emergency or an illness, please notify the instructor as soon as possible. In both cases the instructor will work with you to get you caught up. Students who miss more than five unexcused sessions will have their final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade. If you need to miss class due to a religious observance, please speak to me in advance to make appropriate arrangements.

#### Communication

Various digital channels are used in this course for communication, including email, Discord, and the GitHub issue tracker. Additionally, the course website is used to store the link to the course GitHub Organization, which will contain course syllabus, course schedule and the assignments. Students are responsible for regularly checking all platforms to ensure that the important messages are not being missed.

## Allegheny College Policy and Awareness Statements

### Statement of Community

>  Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms.

### Academic Integrity

Allegheny College has a student-run Honor Code designed to promote individual responsibility and integrity in academic affairs. Each student pledges the following: "I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole." Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer and Information Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students.  Such dialogue is encouraged.  However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else’s work.  It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code.  Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

#### AI Tools

AI tools like OpenAI's GPT code completion, GitHub Co-pilot, and others are professional, industry-grade tools. The use of these tools for learning can be beneficial. However, there is a marked difference between implementing the solutions these tools suggest and copying their suggestions wholesale. In many cases, these tools will lead you to either incorrect or significantly advanced answers. 

While there are many ways that your assignments will test your understanding of the concepts underlying our coursework, I ask a few of things from you, completely aware that you are fully on your own honor with any of these:

- be prepared to explain both verbally and in writing a detailed understanding of the code you're offering for review, documenting where and how you used an assistant tool in:
  - technical reports
  - code comments, specifically labeling the portions of code derived from use of AI tools
- consider how you might improve an assitant-generated solution, documenting this in reports and implementing your improvements in code

### Classroom ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

### Seeking assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the Mayor and teaching assistants. To meet with me, consult my available office hours (above) and make an appointment.

Historically, students who are successful in my courses visit and discuss course concepts with the Mayor and Technical Leaders early and often. See [above for my office hours](#office-hours) or go to [this schedule for Technical Leaders' office hours](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Assistance outside of the course

If you find yourself in difficult circumstances which affect your ability to participate in or complete course work, let me know immediately. Full stop.

Do not wait until the end of the semester. 

Part of my job as the Mayor of `term-world` is to make sure that students receive the assistance they need. Do not hesitate to let me know if there is anything I can do with respect to your ability to handle your work. This is especially true of our current circumstances. Again, let me remind you -- __**it is part of my job**__ to help you access Allegheny College resources that will enable your safety and success.

#### Educational Accommodations (prepared by SASS)

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Student Accessibility and Support Services (SASS) at (814) 332-2898.  Student Accessibility and Support Services is located in Pelletier Library.  Please do this as soon as possible to ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion. Please see [student accessibility website](https://sites.allegheny.edu/studentaccessibility) for more details.

#### Religious Observance (prepared by SRL)

If you need to miss class or reschedule a final examination due to a religious observance, please speak to the professor well in advance to make arrangements. Please see [religious holidays website](https://sites.allegheny.edu/religiouslife/religious-holy-days) for more details.

#### Academic Alerts (prepared by MCSS)

Allegheny College uses an Academic Alert system to send progress notices to the class deans in the Maytum Center for Student Success (MCSS). The progress notices are not punitive. They are an opportunity to connect you with your class dean who can offer additional support and suggest resources if you need assistance. These notices may encourage faculty advisors, coaches (for student-athletes), or other support staff to provide outreach to you as well.

#### Mental Health and Wellness (prepared by Wellness in Student Life)

As a college student, there may be times when personal stressors, struggles, and/or traumas interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. Allegheny College recognizes that mental health is an important piece of the holistic human experience, and that this experience influences your academic success. We encourage students to prioritize their mental well-being by seeking services and support as needed.

Keep in mind, course deadlines, absences, and accommodations for mental health are subject to the course policies and expectations that are set within this syllabus. Students are encouraged to communicate with their professors as soon as possible regarding their needs and seek support if their mental health impacts their academic performance or daily life. When you find yourself struggling emotionally, remember that there are supports available, and you are not alone.

Students who are in need of mental health support can access multiple resources to receive support.  The 98.6 CampusCare app provides physical and behavioral health consultation and supports free of charge 24/7 via telehealth for any actively enrolled student who downloads and signs up with their smartphone.  Allegheny College has also partnered with ECPS (Edinboro Counseling and Psychological Services) to provide in-person therapy on campus. The ECPS partnership with Allegheny College delivers holistic mental health services to the Allegheny College student community through brief individual counseling, and crisis support. Students may request services from ECPS by calling (814) 332-4368 or by emailing the Wellness Case Manager at wellness@allegheny.edu.

If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health emergency, please call the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, Public Safety (814-332-3357), or 911. All of these urgent resources are available 24/7/365.  When in doubt, reach out.

#### Gator Success Grants

The Gator Success Grant program is designed to provide students with additional financial assistance to offset the total cost of college attendance and to encourage successful on-time degree completion. Currently enrolled students who have an unanticipated need are invited to apply. Grants are usually from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars, depending on the request and the student’s need. Please direct questions to `studentsuccess@allegheny.edu`.

#### Class Deans (prepared by MCSS) 

The Office of Class Deans in Pelletier Library serves as a place for students to begin seeking assistance and answers to their questions related to college life. If you have a question and don’t know who to ask – ask a class dean. If you want advice – talk to a class dean. Erin O’Day-Frye is the First Year Class Dean, Amy Stearns is the Second Year Class Dean / Director of Transfer Advising, and Jonathon May is the Third/Fourth Year Class Dean. Please contact them individually or through `studentsuccess@allegheny.edu``.

#### Recording Policy (prepared by Campus Life and Community Standards Committee)

In remote teaching and learning contexts, there is an understanding that instructors (including faculty, coaches, staff, and facilitators) have the right to record class and discussion proceedings.  All other participants must request permission of the instructor in advance before making any additional recordings.  An instructor’s pre-recorded material, including lectures and class notes, may not be shared with anyone outside of the course’s current enrollment without the consent of the instructor. Similarly, under no circumstances may a recording, still, screenshot, picture, or any other media of any sort be altered or circulated by anyone outside of its original intent. No content may be distributed outside the circle of participants without the consent of all who appear or are heard. The college community is reminded of Allegheny College’s Recording Policy, outlined in 9.8 of the Faculty Handbook, as well as Allegheny’s Statement of Community. Violations will be referred to the Student Conduct system.  Classes may also be recorded if approved as an educational accommodation through the Student Accessibility and Support Services. Faculty are further reminded that recordings of class activities are educational records protected under FERPA. While students do not have a right to be anonymous in a class in which they are enrolled, they have the legal right to be anonymous to third parties. Please direct questions about FERPA to the Registrar.

#### Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Reporting (prepared by the Title IX Coordinator)

Allegheny College and Federal law (Title IX) prohibit discrimination and harassment on the basis of sex in College’s programs and activities. If you, or someone you know, has experienced sex-based discrimination or harassment, sexual harassment, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, sexual exploitation, or retaliation contact the College’s Title IX Coordinator to make a report and/or access support and resources:

Gilly Ford, Title IX Coordinator, 814-332-3085 (direct line), `gford@allegheny.edu`

You can access support and resources even if you do not want to take any further action. The College respects your right to file or not file a formal complaint. The Title IX Coordinator must take action only in situations that pose a serious threat of harm to you or the community. 

`Notice that Faculty are Responsible Employees with Mandatory Reporting Obligations:`
Unless specifically identified otherwise by policy, all faculty, staff, and administrators of Allegheny College are considered mandated reporters and are required to notify the College’s Title IX Coordinator of any incident of discrimination and harassment disclosed to them, or known to them, involving a member of the campus community. Mandated reporting helps to ensure that individuals who are experiencing or have experienced discrimination or harassment are connected to the full range of resources and options afforded to them. 
If you are in need of support or advocacy and wish to discuss such matters confidentially, you are invited to consult any of the resources listed below.
